# Dataroom Chatbot

An AI-powered Chrome extension that provides intelligent search and question-answering capabilities for Google Drive dataroom documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## 🌟 Overview

The Dataroom Chatbot helps you quickly find information across multiple documents in your Google Drive by using advanced AI embeddings and natural language processing. Instead of manually searching through dozens of PDFs, spreadsheets, and presentations, simply ask questions in plain English and get accurate answers with source citations.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Intelligent Document Search**: Uses OpenAI embeddings with advanced query decomposition to understand the semantic meaning of your questions
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Distinguishes between fund-level, portfolio-level, and company-specific information to avoid confusion
- **LLM-Based Re-Ranking**: Uses GPT to score and re-rank retrieved chunks for maximum relevance
- **Query Expansion**: Automatically generates semantic variations of your questions for better retrieval
- **Conversation History**: Supports follow-up questions with full conversation context
- **Multi-Format Support**: Processes PDFs, Word docs, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, and Google Workspace files
- **Source Citations**: Every answer includes references to the source documents
- **Persistent Storage**: Embeddings are stored in Google Cloud Storage for fast retrieval
- **Chrome Extension Interface**: Convenient popup interface accessible from any webpage
- **Cloud-Hosted Backend**: Scalable FastAPI backend deployed on Google Cloud Run

### How It Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Downloads files from your Google Drive
2. **Text Extraction**: Parses various file formats into plain text
3. **Enhanced Chunking**: Splits documents into 300-token chunks with overlap and sentence boundary awareness
4. **Contextual Metadata**: Extracts document section context and hierarchical level tags (fund-level, company-level, etc.)
5. **Embedding Creation**: Uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model to create vector embeddings
6. **Index Storage**: Stores embeddings with metadata in FAISS index uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
7. **Intelligent Query Processing**: When you ask a question:
   - **Query Decomposition**: Analyzes intent and classifies information level needed
   - **Query Expansion**: Generates semantic variations while maintaining context
   - **FAISS Retrieval**: Searches for semantically similar chunks
   - **LLM Re-Ranking**: Uses GPT to score chunks for actual relevance (0-10 scale)
   - **Context Filtering**: Ensures appropriate information level (fund vs company vs portfolio)
   - **Enhanced Generation**: GPT-4 generates answers with explicit context awareness
   - **Source Citations**: Returns answer with source file references

## 📋 How to Update the Dataroom 

When you add new documents to your Google Drive dataroom, you need to update the chatbot so it can find the new information. This guide will walk you through the entire process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Open Terminal (Mac Only)

**To open Terminal on Mac:**
1. Press `Cmd + Space` (this opens Spotlight search)
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press Enter or click on "Terminal"

You'll see a black window with text - this is your Terminal where you'll type commands.

**Note**: These instructions are for Mac. If you're on Windows, please contact your technical team for assistance.

---

### Step 2: Check if You Have Homebrew Installed (First Time Only)

Homebrew is a tool that helps install other software on Mac. Let's check if you already have it:

1. In Terminal, type this command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   which brew
   ```

2. **If you see a path** (like `/usr/local/bin/brew` or `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`):
   - ✅ You already have Homebrew! Skip to **Step 3**.

3. **If you see nothing or an error**:
   - ❌ You need to install Homebrew. Continue to **Step 2b**.

### Step 2b: Install Homebrew (If Needed)

If you don't have Homebrew, here's how to install it:

1. Copy and paste this entire command into Terminal and press Enter:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **What's happening**: This downloads and installs Homebrew on your computer.

3. You'll be asked for your Mac password. Type it and press Enter (you won't see characters appear - this is normal for password entry).

4. Wait for the installation to finish (this takes 2-3 minutes). You'll see messages like "Installation successful" when it's done.

5. **If you see instructions about adding Homebrew to your PATH**: Follow those instructions (usually involves copying a command and running it).

---

### Step 3: Install Google Cloud CLI (First Time Only)

The Google Cloud CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that lets your computer talk to Google Cloud. Here's how to install it:

1. In Terminal, type this command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   brew install google-cloud-sdk
   ```

2. **What's happening**: Homebrew is downloading and installing the Google Cloud tools on your computer.

3. Wait for the installation to finish (this takes 2-5 minutes). You'll see a message like "google-cloud-sdk installed successfully" when it's done.

**Note**: You only need to do Steps 2-3 once. After that, you can skip directly to Step 4 for future updates.

---

### Step 4: Set Up Google Cloud Connection (First Time Only)

Before updating the dataroom, you need to tell your computer which Google Cloud project to use and log in. Do this:

1. **Set your Google Cloud project** - Copy and paste this command, but **replace `your-project-id`** with your actual project ID (ask your technical team if you don't know it):
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```
   - **What's happening**: This tells the computer which Google Cloud project belongs to your dataroom.

2. Press Enter. You should see: "Updated property [core/project]"

3. **Log in to Google Cloud** - Copy and paste this command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   - **What's happening**: This opens your web browser and asks you to log in with your Google account. This gives the computer permission to access your dataroom.

4. Complete the login in your browser:
   - Select your Google account
   - Click "Allow" to grant permissions
   - You should see "Credentials saved" in your browser

5. Go back to Terminal - you should see "Credentials saved to file" message.

**Note**: You only need to do Step 4 once. After that, you can skip directly to Step 5 for future updates.

---

### Step 5: Update the Dataroom

Now you're ready to update the dataroom! Here's how:

1. **Get your Cloud Run URL** - You'll need the URL of your deployed chatbot (ask your technical team if you don't have it).

2. Copy and paste this command into Terminal, but **replace `https://gcloud-url/update`** with your actual URL (it should look like `https://dataroom-chatbot-xxxxx.run.app/update`):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://gcloud-url/update
   ```

3. Press Enter.

4. **What's happening**: 
   - The command sends a request to your chatbot server
   - The server downloads all files from your Google Drive dataroom
   - It processes each file with AI to understand the content
   - It updates the search index so the chatbot can find information

5. **Wait 2-5 minutes** - The process takes time depending on how many documents you have. You'll see messages in Terminal as files are processed.

---

### Step 6: Check if Update Succeeded

When the update finishes, you'll see a message like this:

```json
{"status":"success","message":"Dataroom updated successfully","files_processed":47}
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ **"status":"success"** - The update worked perfectly!
- ✅ **"files_processed":47** - Your dataroom has 47 documents that are now searchable
- ✅ **Ready to use** - The chatbot now knows about all your documents

**If you see an error message instead:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes and try Step 5 again
- Check your internet connection
- If it still doesn't work, contact your technical team

---

### Step 7: Test It Works

Now test that the update worked:

1. Open your Chrome browser
2. Click on the Dataroom Chatbot extension icon
3. Ask a question about the new documents you added
4. The chatbot should be able to answer using the newly added documents!

---

### Quick Reference for Future Updates

Once you've done Steps 1-4 the first time, future updates are much simpler:

1. Open Terminal
2. Run the update command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-actual-url/update
   ```
3. Wait for success message
4. Done!

---

### When to Update the Dataroom

Update the dataroom whenever you:
- ✅ Add new documents to your Google Drive dataroom folder
- ✅ Modify or update existing documents
- ✅ Want to ensure the chatbot has the very latest information

**Important Note**: The chatbot only searches documents in your specific Google Drive dataroom folder, not your entire Google Drive. Make sure new documents are added to the correct folder!
